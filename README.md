# Japan Hostel

For preparation for my three weeks in Japan I needed to find 
cheap but homely accommodation.
As a fun side project I decided to investigate the attributes of Hostels in
Japan, specifically the cities I would be staying in -- Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka.

## The Dataset

The dataset comes from [Hostel World](https://www.hostelworld.com/)
